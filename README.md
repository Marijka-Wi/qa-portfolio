## 🧪 Projects  

### 🎮 **Farming Fever (Android – Alpha build)**  
**Role:** Manual QA Engineer  
**Scope:**  
- Installation & launch testing  
- Core gameplay and UI  
- Economy system (coins, rubies, lives)  
- Reward mechanics and sound behaviour  
- Debug GUI accessibility  

**Deliverables:**  
📄 [Test Report & Checklist](reports/Farming_Fever_Test_Report_Maria_Wittwer.pdf)  
🐞 [Bug List](reports/Bug_List.xlsx)  

**Key findings:**  
- Help button non-responsive  
- Reward video not triggered (rubies not added)  
- Sound stutters occasionally  
- Debug GUI visible to player (should be restricted)  

**Outcome:**  
The alpha build is stable and playable.  
However, access to debug GUI and broken reward logic are major issues for release.  
Overall, the project demonstrates solid potential and serves as a strong QA case study.
